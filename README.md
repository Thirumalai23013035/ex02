EXP:2 Player Movement, Collectables, Health, and Score System in Unreal Engine
Aim

To implement a basic player controller using the Character class in Unreal Engine, with movement controls, collectable items, a health system, and a score display.
Procedure
1. Create Player Character with Movement

    Create a Blueprint Class based on Character (e.g., BP_PlayerCharacter).
    Add a Camera and Spring Arm for third-person or first-person view.
    In the Event Graph, add input bindings for movement:
        MoveForward, MoveRight using InputAxis events.
        Use Add Movement Input for directional movement.

2. Create Collectable Item

    Create a new Actor Blueprint (e.g., BP_Collectable).
    Add a Static Mesh and Sphere Collision component.
    On BeginOverlap with player:
        Destroy the collectable.
        Call a custom event or function on the player to increment score or health.

3. Implement Health System

    In BP_PlayerCharacter, add a Health variable (e.g., float, default: 100).
    Create a TakeDamage function to subtract from Health.
    Optionally, implement logic to handle 0 health (e.g., death or respawn).

4. Implement Score System

    Add a Score variable (int) in BP_PlayerCharacter.
    When a collectable is picked up, increase the score.
    Display score using UMG Widget:
        Create a Widget Blueprint (e.g., W_HUD).
        Add Text Blocks bound to Health and Score variables.

5. Setup Game Mode

    Create a new Game Mode Blueprint.
    Set BP_PlayerCharacter as the default pawn.
    Set the HUD widget in the Game Modeâ€™s BeginPlay using Create Widget and Add to Viewport.

Result

A working prototype was developed with:

    Player movement using the Character class.
    Collectable items that increase score or health.
    A dynamic health system with logic for damage.
    On-screen UI displaying player health and score.

This system forms the basis for more advanced gameplay mechanics in Unreal Engine.
